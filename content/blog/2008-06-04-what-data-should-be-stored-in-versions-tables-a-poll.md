Hello,

I&#8217;ve posted a poll on what data should be stored in versions tables in [Envers][1], see here and cast your vote:

<http://www.jboss.com/index.html?module=bb&op=viewtopic&t=136764>

The results will determine the future implementation, so votes really count. And as always, comments & ideas are very welcome.

The two options, in short, are:

  1. Store only historical data in the versions table, making queries poorer and more difficult (you always have to combine data from two sources &#8211; the versions and &#8220;current&#8221; tables)
  2. Store all data in the versions table, making queries easier and more powerful. This however duplicates the &#8220;current&#8221; data.
