Some [Envers][1] uses had problems because of the limited flexibility in specifying which fields from superclasses (especially those annotated with `@MappedSuperclass`) should be audited or not. We improved a bit in the latest release, by being able to explicitly enumerate the superclasses to audit.

But still this is not fully flexible. That&#8217;s why [≈Åukasz Antoniak][2] started a discussion on the Envers forum (<http://community.jboss.org/message/624057#624057>) to gather remarks and use-cases on how people use Envers with inheritance. Your opinion will be very valuable to us, so please share!
