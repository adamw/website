This Friday (6th of May) I will have the pleasure to present two talks: one on [Envers][1] and one on [Torquebox][2], thanks to an invitation from the [RivieraJUG][3].

Envers is a data auditing/versioning module of [Hibernate][4]; with a single `@Audited` annotation all changes to the selected entity will be written and available for easy retrieval.

TorqueBox, which recently [reached version 1.0][5], is a JBoss-based Ruby server, integrating the Ruby and Java worlds. JBoss services are exposed using Ruby APIs, and you can deploy both Ruby (including Ruby On Rails) and &#8220;traditional&#8221; JEE apps to the server.

Expect a lot of **live demos**! I will show how to use the basic functionalities of Envers to implement data auditing, some advanced features as well as how Envers maps data to its database schema. I will also roughly explain how Envers is built and what is needed to &#8220;build your own Envers&#8221; &#8211; it&#8217;s not as complicated as it looks, Hibernate offers a lot of not-well-known but powerful features. 

In the Torquebox talk, we will create a simple Ruby On Rails application and deploy it to Torquebox. Later, we will add a java module which contains [CDI beans][6] (CDI is the new dependency injection framework in JEE6) and integrate the Ruby On Rails app with our CDI beans. Also, we will create a simple scheduler service using Torquebox&#8217;s API and an integration test of java module using [Arquillian][7].

The meeting will be held at [INRIA Sophia-Antipolis][8] on 6pm. [See the announcement][9] for details. 

And see you there! :)
