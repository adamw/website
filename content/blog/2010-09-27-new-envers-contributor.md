I&#8217;d like to welcome Erik-Berndt Scheper as our new [Envers][1] contributor. His first commit was yesterday (rev 20717 and 20718), resolving the [HHH-5560][2] issue.

Erik was submitting for some time very good patches (with docs&tests), most recently for finishing the [validity audit strategy support][3]. He is also an active forums member.

Waiting for next commits & welcome :)  
Adam
