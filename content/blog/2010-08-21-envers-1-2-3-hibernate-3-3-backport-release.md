Hernan Chanfreau backported some of the recent Envers changes and fixes from the 3.5 branch. The detailed list of the backported issues can be found in [this forum post][1]. 

I applied the patch and released a new Hibernate-3.3 compatible Envers version, it&#8217;s available in the [JBoss Maven repository][2].

Thanks a lot to Hernan for the work and providing the patch! :)
