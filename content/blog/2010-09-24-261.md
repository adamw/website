Thanks to the patch provided by Matthew B. Jones, and improved by Erik-Berndt Scheper, the new Envers [ValidTimeAuditStrategy][1] (which will be renamed to `ValidityAuditStrategy` in upcoming releases) now leverages the additional information held in the end-revision column when creating queries; they no longer need to use subselects to find an entity at a given revision (JIRA issue [HHH-5372][2]).

This means a big performance gain when running the queries (at the cost of the additional column having to be filled). Tests conducted by Matthew B. Jones indicate more than a 10-fold improvement over the old strategy.

If you&#8217;d like to check out the new code, it&#8217;s available in [Hibernate 3.6.0.CR1][3]; the documentation is [here][4]. Remember it&#8217;s still in an experimental state, but feedback is very welcome!
