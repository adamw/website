I&#8217;ll be [speaking][1] about the [JSR-308 specification][2] (annotations on java types), which will be part of Java 7, on the GeeCON conference, which will take place from the 13th till the 14th of May 2010 in [Poznan][3], Poland.

Apart from an introduction to the new annotations, I will cover the checkers framework, and do a live demo of some of the bundled checkers (nullability, immutability), as well as of my [typestate checker][4]. I will also show how to implement a simple custom checker, using the framework.

If you&#8217;ll be there, be sure not to miss it. If you&#8217;ve not yet registered, visit <http://2010.geecon.org> :).

See you there,  
Adam
