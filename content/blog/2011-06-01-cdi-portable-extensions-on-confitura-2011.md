In less than two weeks (11th June) I will have the opportunity to present a talk on [CDI & Portable Extensions][1] during the [Confitura 2011][2] conference, organized by the [Warsaw JUG][3].

The talk will consist mainly of live demos, so fun! :)

I will show how to create two portable extensions:

  * one which dynamically chooses which bean implementation will be available to the application 
      * second which creates new CDI (injectable) beans at startup, exposing some of the other bean meta-data </ul> 
        as well as how to implement &#8220;AOP++&#8221;. All tested with [Arquillian][4].
        
        All of the examples used in the talk are backed by real-life use-cases from applications created by my company, [SoftwareMill][5].
        
        The registration is over, but the conference is free, so if you know polish and will be in Warsaw, you are welcome to join!
