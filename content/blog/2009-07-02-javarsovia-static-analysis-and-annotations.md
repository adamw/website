If you&#8217;ll be in Warsaw this weekend, and if you speak polish, be sure not to miss [Javarsovia][1], a one-day conference organized by the Warsaw JUG. I am giving a talk there about how you can use annotations together with static analysis to find bugs in your program early (first presentation in the 3rd track, 9:45, room 103B). Among other things, I&#8217;ll be demoing the [static access detector][2] and the [typestate checker][3].

See you there!  
Adam
