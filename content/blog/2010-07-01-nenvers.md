If you are a .NET and [NHibernate][1] user, soon you&#8217;ll be able to use [Envers][2] in your project!

Simon Duduica has been working on an Envers to .NET port. This is still work in progress, but you can check out the current source code here: https://nhcontrib.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/nhcontrib/trunk/sandbox/simondud/Envers.NET

A large portion was ported, but there&#8217;s also quite a lot left, so any help is appreciated. Big thanks to Simon and looking forward to a release :)
