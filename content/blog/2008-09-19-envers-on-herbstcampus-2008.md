Yesterday I came back from [Herbstcampus 2008][1] in NÃ¼rnberg. I gave there a talk on [Envers][2]. Thanks to all who attended! I&#8217;d also like to thank the organisers, everything went smoothly and I felt really welcome there :).

You can find the slides [here][3]. They lack of course the added value of &#8220;live comments&#8221;, but if you&#8217;ve got any questions, please write on the [forum][4].
