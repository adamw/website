Hello,

Envers is a project which enables you to version your entities, simply by annotating them with `@Versioned`! It is still very young, and far from a mature project, but some basic functionalities already work.

The project&#8217;s web page can be found here: [www.jboss.org/envers][1]. There you can download a preview version, a short console demo as well as find a &#8220;quick start&#8221; guide.

I&#8217;d really like to know your opinion on this project, if you find it useful, what features would you expect and so on. So please comment! :)

Adam
