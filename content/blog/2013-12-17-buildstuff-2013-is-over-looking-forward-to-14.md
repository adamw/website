I just came back from the [BuildStuff][1] conference in Vilnius, Lithuania (actually this was almost a week ago, but I was writing that back at the airport ;) ). Although it’s not so well known, and it’s only the second edition, I must say that it was a really great conference.

I think the best thing about the conference was its diversity. Usually I attend various Java- or JVM- themed conferences. BuildStuff, on the other hand, is truly a **software development** conference. There were talks on F#, Erlang, Scala, (other languages), Agile as well as general “philosophical” talks. It’s really interesting to find out what’s happening outside of your usual ecosystem &#8211; there may be some great ideas waiting!

Just as an example, the way you can do data exploration and visualisation using F#’s REPL and type providers &#8211; really nice ([Tomas Petricek][2]/[Mathias Brandewinder][3]). Or real-life examples of how you can use QuickCheck to find bugs in your code ([John Hughes][4]) will hopefully finally motivate me to start using [Scala Check][5]. Or did you know that there’s an open-source sub-orbital manned rocket being built ([Copenhagen suborbitals][6])? 

Overall, the speaker lineup was really good; as for the idea/knowledge-value of the conference, BuildStuff is on par with other great conferences, like [Devoxx][7] or [JavaZone][7] (which I visited this year as well). Plus, both after-parties were really good. It&#8217;s a pity I had my talk scheduled in the morning after the main party so I couldn&#8217;t stay until the end ;).

Some things could be of course improved, like the sound quality in some of the rooms, but that’s just minor technical glitches.

Thanks to [Neringa][8] and [Greg Young][9] and their team I also had an opportunity to present: I was talking about Scala, Dependency Injection, Macros and my own project, [MacWire][10]. [You can find the slides here][11]. 

Looking forward to [BuildStuff 2014][1]!

Adam
