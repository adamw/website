Here's the bio I usually share:

I am one of the co-founders of SoftwareMill, where I code mainly using Scala and other interesting technologies. I am involved in open-source projects, such as ox, tapir, sttp, quicklens, elasticmq and others. I have been a speaker at major conferences, such as JavaOne, LambdaConf, Devoxx and ScalaDays.

Apart from writing closed- and open-source software, in my free time I try to read the Internet on various (functional) programming-related subjects. Any ideas or insights usually end up with a blog.
