I'm a programmer: starting with Quick Basic and Turbo Pascal in the '90; through Scheme, OCaml, Smalltalk, Prolog, C and Java during studies. All the way to more Java, Scala and other JVM (and some non-JVM) languages during my professional career. 

I completed a master's degree in Computer Science at the [University of Warsaw](https://www.mimuw.edu.pl/en/). After that, I've worked at [JBoss/RedHat](https://jboss.com), where I got introduced both to remote work and to open-source software. Both of these stayed with me: I've worked remotely ever since (our company is fully remote), and we're heavy users (and developers) of OSS. Later I did some Java consulting and development; in 2009 together with Tomek, Jan and Pawe≈Ç we co-founded [SoftwareMill](https://softwaremill.com). That's where I work to this day, leading the research & development efforts. Since 2023 we're part of the [VirtusLab group](https://virtuslab.com/about-us/). 

I've been involved in creating and maintaining open-source [projects](https://warski.org/projects/) for more than 16 years. I enjoy sharing what I learn, through [articles](https://warski.org/articles/), [videos](https://warski.org/videos/) and [conferences](https://warski.org/talks/). Not only it's great to see your work being useful to others, but the community is also a great gauge as to which ideas are worth pursing and solve real problems, and which don't.

My main interests always revolved around the back-end, lately gravitating towards "developer experience". I highly value the elegance and code verification capabilities granted by statically typed functional programming. One of my goals is to expand the presence of FP in "everyday" programming toolkits. This means balancing practicality, conciseness, maintainability, abstraction and safety. It also involves understanding the fundamental benefits and tradeoffs that approaches such as functional or reactive programming bring.

Another axis of my interests are distributed systems and architectures, once again especially when it comes to understanding the fundamental value and limitations that each specific approach brings. My goal here is to be able to be technically honest when it comes to choosing and recommending a specific approach: not based on personal preferences or fashions, but on sound technical arguments. That's why a number of my articles explore architectures of systems like Kafka, their scaling and replication characteristics, and various approaches to messaging.

Finally, since IT stands for "Information Technology", I think that there's underappreciated value in making sure that the information - data - doesn't disappear. On one hand this means data replication, on the other: not deleting the data in the first place. That is the focus of the Envers project, as well as of my research into event sourcing, which might be implemented successfully not only through large-scale architectures like CQRS, but also in smaller, relational systems.
